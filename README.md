This github repo is for a wedding website that allows you to find your table number given a name in the Wedding seating.csv file.

You can access the website at tsbowman00.github.io, though I may try to replace this with a custom domain name.

Recall that to add files from the terminal you need to use the following syntax"
% git add --all
% git commit -m "Commit message"
% git push -u origin main
